# libdsa â€“ Common Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This is a collection of common data structures and algorithms, implemented in
the C programming language for learning purposes. The implementations are kept
simple so everybody with basic knowledge of the C language can read and
understand the code.

The implementations are influenced by the examples in Zed A. Shaw's *Learn C
the Hard Way*, but each of them was rewritten from scratch. The same goes for
the testing and debugging macros in `debug.h` and `unittest.h`.

Suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Keep in mind that this is a study
project.


## Available data structures

2. [List](./doc/list.md)
